# bspwm-setup
Single point deployment script for my bspwm setup that gets me up an running from after a fresh install.

Note that everything here is, of course, biased towards my own preferences.

## Usage
Verify that `install.sh` doesn't do anything shady, then run it.

```bash
./install.sh
```

Currently supports Arch-based distros, but can be expanded by adding the appropriate package list.
